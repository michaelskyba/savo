It's like the backstory

=================================================

In the middle of one seemingly normal night, Claudia woke up to go to the
bathroom. On her way back, she was curious about what time it was. So, she
opened up her laptop to check the time on her lockscreen.
...

Instead of the time, she saw a frightening message:
    "Working on updates
        24% complete
Don't turn off your computer"
...

Claudia was enraged. This was the last straw! She vowed to purge her her
computer of this mess of an operating system the next morning. Surely, something
better was out there. Claudia went back to sleep, restless from her
anticipation.
...

The next morning, she looked at her pitiful laptop and again was overcome with
conviction. Her mother had entered the room.

Claudia: "Hey Mom, I need a new operating system on the laptop you bought me."

Valeria: "Are you sure about this? The path you're speaking about so casually is
filled with pain and regret."

Claudia hesitated, but after a couple of minutes of silence, she spoke.

Claudia: "That isn't enough to convince me to back down. I'm tired of my
experience with this laptop."

Valeria: "Very well. Don't blame me in the future for permitting this."

...

Valeria: "What you're looking for is Nero Linux, the best Linux
distribution."

Claudia: "Linux distribution? What's that?"

Valeria: "Don't worry about the details for now. Anyway, there are broadly two
steps before you have a perfect operating system. First, you need to acquire the
Nero Linux ROM, which will be used to isntall the operating system."
Valeria: "This is hidden far away in the land of Lerwick, owned by your
stepbrother."

Claudia: "Stepbrother...? But you haven't died yet, and father hasn't married
Julia Agrippina yet. I don't have a stepbrother."

Valeria: "Fool! Don't hold any sort of expectations of historical accuracy!"

Claudia: "A-alright, I suppose..."

Valeria: "Once you've acquired the ROM, you have a second problem: no drivers
exist for your Kepler GPU."

Claudia: "What's a driver? Cars aren't going exist a while."

Valeria: "Again, disregard the details for the moment. All it means in the
broader sense is that you're going to have to program your own."

Claudia: "Programming? You mean that thing that losers do?"

Valeria: "Hey, I'm trying to help you here."

Claudia: "Anyway, I haven't been paying attention. Just tell me what I need to
do first."

Valeria: "That kind of mindset is not ready for success. I suppose I'll have you
understand that out on your own... The first step is to head on down to Nova
Anio-akvedukto."

Claudia: "Hah, you mean Aqua Anio Novus? Esperanto comes right after the drivers
from earlier."

Valeria: "You've already forgotten what I said a minute ago? Forget your
attachment to consistency instead!"

Valeria: "Once you arrive at Nova Anio-akvedukto, talk to Frontinus. Tell him to
'show you the door'."

Claudia: "Got it: Go to Nova Anio-akvedukto, tell Frontinus to show me the door."
Claudia: "Thanks, Mom!"

Valeria: "Your gratitude is misplaced."
