The Akvedukto tutorial and introduction

1. Introduction (phase 0)
	(Hello, who are you?, etc.)
2. Attacking Explanation (phase 1)
	- You can't attack infinitely because of the cooldown
	- Explain how the larger square shows your attack range
3. Attacking practice (phase 2)
	- You attack him a few times until his HP hits 0
	- While this is happening, he doesn't attack you
4. Timing explanation (phase 3)
	- When the number counts down to 0, the sword will swing, so plan accordingly
	- In the future, number patterns may be "slightly more difficult" to predict
	and time
5. Timing practice (phase 4)
	- You attack him while he attacks back
	- You can't heal or dodge, or it's just about moving back and forth in
	accordance to the timer
6. Healing explanation (phase 5)
	- When you get hit, you will lose one HP and become "threatened"
	- If you are hit while threatened, you will die, so you want to remove this
	"threatened" state
	- That is done with healing (C) which slows down your movement temporarily
	and uses an action (as with your attack)
7. Healing practice (phase 6)
	- You are allowed to take damage and heal now
	- You are blocked in by two walls next to Frontinus, so you can't avoid
	taking damage (dodging is still disabled)
	- Set the timer to 10 half-seconds instead of 5 or something like that to
	make it easier to heal in time for the next attack
8. Dodging explanation (phase 7)
	- Invincible during the (green) dodge cooldown but can't dodge again because
	of the action cooldown
	- The action cooldown lasts longer than the dodge cooldown so you can't spam
	Z infinitely to guarantee avoiding damage; you have to time it
9. Dodging practice (phase 8)
	- Disable healing to force dodging instead
	- Use the walls from before again to force Z dodging instead of movement
	dodging
10. Conclusion (phase 9)
	That's about all you need to know, etc.
	Talk to me again if you want to replay the tutorial, etc.
	Here's a hole in the wall that lets you progress to Lerwick, etc.
