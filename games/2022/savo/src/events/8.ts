// Dialogue in Augustus' room

/*
Wait, didn't you die in AD 14?
Either you're supposed to be dead, or I'm not supposed to be alive.

It's the former. You're right; I'm supposed to be dead.
And yet, I am not.
Does that fact intensely trouble you?

It does. How can you be content with contradiction?
Have you never heard of the explosion principle?

I have, but it does not apply. Your view of 'logic' is too narrow-minded.
Regardless, I can already infer why you are here.

What's your conclusion?

You're here to suffer, are you not?
You're capable of slaying Nero flawlessly and yearn for defeat?

What if I'm not?

If you can't do something as simple as overpowering poor Nero...
You're out of your territory here.

What if I am?

You'll still be disappointed. Go home, or you'll regret it.

Thanks for the offer, but I think I'll stay.
You'll probably even fail to provide a sufficient amount of suffering...
By the way, was that Tiberius Caesar Augustus in the other room?

No, obviously. Don't get confused just because his name tag uses his first name.

But wouldn't 'Britannicus' be more accurate, then?

Who cares?

...

Here is my proposal.
You're clearly not thinking straight, so I'll give you three minutes.
If, after the three minutes, your intent for misfortune exists, I won't stop myself.

You think that will make me change my mind?
Although, waiting three minutes does seem kind of annoying...

Of course it does. So, leave.

I wonder if it's possible to skip this...

(New state)
	Stickied:
	Hmm... I wish I had Tiberius's time machine right now...

	(movement enabled)
	(display timer)
	(keep playing climactic_return)
	(have the exit open)

(once the timer is over)
	Three minutes is up. My intent is everlasting.

	I see. Let's begin, then.

	(Start climax_reasoning)
	(once the drum drops, add more enemies)
		think of a good system
