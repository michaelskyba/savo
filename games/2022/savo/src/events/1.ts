		[null, "..."],

		[null, "The next morning, she looked at her pitiful laptop and again was overcome with conviction."],

		[null, "Claudia hesitated, but after a couple of minutes of silence, she spoke."],

		["Messalina", "What you're looking for is Nero Linux, the best Linux distribution."],

		["Messalina", "Don't worry about the details for now."],
		["Messalina", "Anyway, there are broadly two steps before you have a perfect operating system."],
		["Messalina", "First, you need to acquire the Nero Linux ROM, which will be used to install the OS."],
		["Messalina", "This is hidden far away in the land of Lerwick, owned by your stepbrother."],
		["Claudia", "Stepbrother...? But you haven't died yet, and father hasn't married Julia Agrippina yet."],
		["Claudia", "I don't have a stepbrother."],
		["Messalina", "Fool! Don't hold any sort of expectations of historical accuracy!"],
		["Claudia", "A-alright, I suppose..."],
		["Messalina", "Once you've acquired the ROM, you have a second problem: no drivers exist for your Kepler GPU."],
		["Claudia", "What's a driver? Cars aren't going exist a while."],
		["Messalina", "Again, disregard the details for the moment."],
		["Claudia", "All it means in the broader sense is that you're going to have to program your own."],
		["Claudia", "Programming? You mean that thing that losers do?"],
		["Messalina", "Hey, I'm trying to help you here."],

		["Claudia", "Anyway, I haven't been paying attention. Just tell me the first thing I need to do."],
		["Messalina", "That kind of mindset is not ready for success."],
		["Messalina", "I suppose I'll have you understand that out on your own..."],
		["Messalina", "Well, the first step is to head up to Nova Anio-akvedukto."],
		["Claudia", "Hah, you mean Aqua Anio Novus? Esperanto comes right after the drivers from earlier."],
		["Messalina", "You've already forgotten what I said a minute ago?"],
		["Messalina", "Forget your attachment to consistency instead!"],
		["Messalina", "Once you arrive at Nova Anio-akvedukto, talk to Frontinus."],
		["Messalina", "Tell him to 'show you the door'."],
		["Claudia", "Got it: Go to Nova Anio-akvedukto, tell Frontinus to show me the door."],
		["Claudia", "Thanks, Mom!"],
		["Messalina", "Your gratitude is misplaced."]
