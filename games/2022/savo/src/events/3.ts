	bed: [
		["Claudia", "This bed was $500, including the mattress."],
		["Claudia", "How much time would I need to work to make that much money?"],
		["Claudia", "How much am I losing?"],
		["Claudia", "Hmm..."],
		["Claudia", "Well, the market's been going up by 10% around here for 100 years."],
		["Claudia", "So, in twenty years, that $500 would be 500 * 1.1^20..."],
		["Claudia", "... ~= $3363.75!"],
		["Claudia", "Is this bed really worth that?"],
		["Claudia", "Could I live without it?"],
		["Claudia", "Well, sleeping on the wooden floor hurts quite a bit."],
		["Claudia", "But, what about a foldable, less expensive mattress like GOKUMIN?"],
		["Claudia", "Yeah, that's a way better idea. It could double as a seat!"],
		["Claudia", "But wait... what about the shipping costs?"],
		["Claudia", "I live too far away from the manufacturer..."],
		["Claudia", "What to do?"],
		["Claudia", "Hmm..."]
	],

	bookshelf: [
		["Claudia", "There are so many books that I haven't had a chance to read..."],
		["Claudia", "But, would the time investment really be worth it?"],
		["Claudia", "What if new research has deprecated their contents?"],
		["Claudia", "None are particularly recent, after all."],
		["Claudia", "Additionally, research online is simply more convenient."],
		["Claudia", "Why, then, is 'knowledge' more (socially) paired with books than with the internet?"],
		["Claudia", "Did the association appear before the world's knowledge made its way over?"],
		["Claudia", "Does public impression take that long to shift?"],
		["Claudia", "Or maybe the medium of books does have an important, inherent advantage..."],
		["Claudia", "Why can't I see it?"],
		["Claudia", "I can only think of further disadvantages, like the lack of portability."],
		["Claudia", "Hmm..."]
	],

	stove: [
		["Claudia", "Interesting. The stove is still on, yet nobody seems to be watching it."],
		["Claudia", "Is this a fire hazard? Should I take responsibility and turn it off?"],
		["Claudia", "No, I'll just let somebody else worry about it."],
		["Claudia", "My house has never burned down before, so why would it start now?"]

	claudius: [
		["Claudia", "Hey, Dad."],
		["Claudius", "..."],
		["Claudia", "No reply? Can you hear me? Or has your deafness worsened?"],
		["Claudius", "..."],
		["Claudia", "Oh, you're ignoring me."],
		["Claudia", "Good luck at your next trial, I suppose."],
		["Claudia", "Not that I have any reason to care about your personal interests..."],
