		["Claudia", "Either you're supposed to be dead, or I'm not supposed to be alive."],
		["Augustus", "It's the former. You're right; I'm supposed to be dead."],
		["Augustus", "And yet, I am not."],
		["Augustus", "Does that fact intensely trouble you?"],
		["Claudia", "It does. How can you be content with contradiction?"],
		["Claudia", "Have you never heard of the explosion principle?"],
		["Augustus", "I have, but it does not apply. Your view of 'logic' is too narrow-minded."],

		["Augustus", "Regardless, I can already infer why you are here."],
		["Claudia", "What's your conclusion?"],
		["Augustus", "You're here to suffer, are you not?"],
		["Augustus", "You're capable of slaying Nero flawlessly and yearn for defeat?"],
		["Claudia", "What if I'm not?"],
		["Augustus", "If you can't do something as simple as overpowering poor Nero..."],
		["Augustus", "You're out of your territory here."],
		["Claudia", "What if I am?"],
		["Augustus", "You'll still be disappointed. Go home, or you'll regret it."],
		["Claudia", "Thanks for the offer, but I think I'll stay."],
		["Claudia", "You'll probably even fail to provide a sufficient amount of suffering..."],

		["Claudia", "By the way, was that Tiberius Caesar Augustus in the other room?"],
		["Augustus", "No, obviously. Don't get confused just because his name tag uses his first name."],
		["Claudia", "But wouldn't 'Britannicus' be more accurate, then?"],
		["Augustus", "Who cares?"],
		["Claudia", "..."],

		["Augustus", "Here is my proposal."],
		["Augustus", "You're clearly not thinking straight, so I'll give you three minutes."],
		["Augustus", "If, after the three minutes, your intent for misfortune exists, I won't stop myself."],
		["Claudia", "You think that will make me change my mind?"],
		["Claudia", "Although, waiting three minutes does seem kind of annoying..."],
		["Augustus", "Of course it does. So, leave."],
		["Claudia", "I wonder if it's possible to 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗽 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀..."]
