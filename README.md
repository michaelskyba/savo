# Malfacile Gajnita Savo
This was made as a final project for an introductory CS high school course

## Building: ``./build``
I made a "build" script to avoid having to type something manually and to avoid
using node.js. It depends on TypeScript (tsc) for the ``src/*.ts`` -->
``out-ts/*.js`` compilation and entr for checking for file updates.
