# Malfacile Gajnita Savo
This was made as a final project for an introductory CS high school course

## Building: ``./build``
I made a "build" script to avoid having to type something manually and to avoid
using an annoying node.js configuration. It depends on TypeScript (tsc) for the
``src/*.ts`` --> ``out-ts/*.js`` compilation, entr for checking for file
updates, and npx (npm) for rollup.
