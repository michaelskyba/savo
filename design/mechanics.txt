Dialogue / text
	Use (e.g.) Z to select an option or progress through dialogue

	The letters should appear incrementally like in Undertale
		Pressing Z would finish rendering it instantly if it's not done yet

	When there's something particularly important, especially something easy to
	miss, like a somewhat vague hint about an action required for progression,
	make the important part's text colour different

	Whenever a character's text prompt appears, it should play a sound (one
	note/sound - not a melody). Each of Claudia's might play a recorder,
	Valeria's a piano, Tiberius's a trumpet, etc.

	Maybe each character could have a different text colour as well
